Coconut-Coconut is a simple, elegant, Pythonic functional programming language that compiles to Python. Since all valid Python is valid Coconut, using Coconut will only extend and enhance what you're already capable of in Python

Oden
---
Oden is an experimental, statically typed, functional programming language, built for the Go ecosystem. It aims to leverage the great features of Go — static linking, cross-compilation, goroutines, channels and the great set of libraries and tools— and enable higher-level abstractions, generics and a safer yet more flexible type system.

Crystal
-------
Crystal- Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:
Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
Compile to efficient native code.
