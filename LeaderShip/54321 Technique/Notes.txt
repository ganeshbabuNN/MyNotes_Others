This is a simple yet effective technique for bringing us back in the present moment & helps in
regaining control of our emotions by relying on our five senses - sight, sound, touch, smell, and
taste.

In this technique, you first have to identify 5 things which u can see around you, it could be
anything, chair, table, your colleague sitting next to you, painting on the wall, anything. 
JUst identify 5 things

Next identify 4 things which u can feel. Example - the temperature of ac, the pencil in your hand,
u can fold your hands, and feel the warmth, texture of the desk in front of you, etc
Next identify 3 things which u can hear. Example - traffic noize, people talking around u, noise of
the fan, etc

Next identify 2 things which u can smell. The smell of your breath, any other odour which u can
smell

Lastly identify 1 thing which u can taste. Just fee; your tongue. Does it feel very dry, u can
