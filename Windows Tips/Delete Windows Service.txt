1. Run Regedit or Regedt32
2. Find the registry entry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services"
3. Look for the service there and delete it. You can look at the keys to know what files the service was using and delete them as well (if necessary).
alternatively, you can also use command prompt and delete a service using following command:

sc delete < SERVICE name>

-get the service name from the windows services , double click on it and copy the service name

exp
sc delete “Adobe LM Service”

or to create, simply type 
sc create <SERVICE name>

Update: 
If you have space in the file path you need to use quotation marks ("). For example: 
sc create "MySQL" binpath= "C:\Archivos de programa\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin\mysqld.exe"
