*****
The EC-Council CCISO Body of Knowledge covers all five the CCISO Information Security Management Domains in depth and was written by seasoned CISOs for current and aspiring CISOs. 
-Domain 1 covers the Policy, Legal, and Compliance aspects of Governance. 
-Domain 2 delves into the all-important topic of audit management from the CISO’s perspective and also covers IS controls.
-Domain 3 covers the Role of the CISO from a Project and Operations Management perspective
- Domain 4 summarizes the technical aspects that CISOs manage in their day-to-day jobs, but from an executive standpoint. 
-Domain 5 is all about Strategic Planning and Finance – crucial areas for C-Level executives to understand in order to succeed and drive information security throughout their organizations.

Why Requires
-----------
-The CCISO Certification is an industry-leading program that recognizes the real-world experience necessary to succeed at the highest executive levels of information security.  
-Bringing together all the components required for a C-Level positions, the CCISO program combines audit management, governance, IS controls, human capital management, strategic program development, and the financial expertise vital to leading a highly successful IS program.
-Material in the CCISO Program assumes a high-level understanding of technical topics and doesn’t spend much time on strictly technical information, but rather on the application of technical knowledge to an information security executive’s day-to-day work.  
-The CCISO aims to bridge the gap between the executive management knowledge that CISOs need and the technical knowledge that many aspiring CISOs have.  This can be a crucial gap as a practitioner endeavors to move from mid-management to upper, executive management roles.  Much of this is traditionally learned as on the job training, but the CCISO Training Program can be the key to a successful transition to the highest ranks of information security management.
